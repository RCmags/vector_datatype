# vector_datatype
This is a library for 3d vectors and quaternions. It includes two structs to define each datatype. Both vectors and quaternions can perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, decrement, and their analogs for multiplication and division. Vectors and quaternions are also compatible with each other.  

Other operations included such as vector dot product and cross product. Quaternions can also rotate and scale a vector. They can also be constructed as unit quaternions to represent a pure rotation. Both datatypes are compatible with arrays, meaning that a length-3 array can be added, subtracted, etc from a vector. This is the same for quaternions.
