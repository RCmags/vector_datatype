# vector_datatype
This is a library for 3d vectors and quaternions. It includes two structs to define each datatype. Both vectors and quaternions can perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, increment, decrement, and their analogs for multiplication and division. Vectors and quaternions are also compatible with each other.  

Included are other operations such as vector dot product and cross product. Quaternions can also be constructed as unit quaternions to represent rotations. They can also rotate vectors. Both datatypes are compatible with arrays, meaning that a length-3 array can be added, subtracted, etc from a vector. This also applies to quaternions.
